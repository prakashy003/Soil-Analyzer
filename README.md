The project leverages machine learning to predict soil fertility, creating a Soil Fertility Index (SFI) based on a comprehensive dataset of soil parameters. This innovation empowers farmers to optimize agricultural practices by providing precise recommendations for fertilizer application, saving time and resources. A user-friendly interface enables easy data input and informed decision-making. Beyond cost efficiency, the project promotes long-term sustainability and advances fertilizer optimization.
